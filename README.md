# Prediction-And-Reccomendation-System-For-Stocks
This project implements an advanced Stock Market Prediction and Recommendation System using K-means Clustering with Regression. It leverages key technical indicators such as Moving Averages (SMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) to analyze stock performance and predict future trends. The system provides data-driven insights and clear recommendations, supported by visual representations like trend arrows and graphical charts, to aid strategic investment decisions based on market behavior and technical analysis.
